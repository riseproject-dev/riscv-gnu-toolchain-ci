# RISE GCC CI Toolchain Maintenance

This fork carries the toolchain scripts, helper utilities, allowlists, and
submodule revisions used by the RISE GCC RISC-V CI services.

## Branch Ownership

`build-frequent` is the CI-maintained branch. It is consumed as a pinned
submodule by:

- `riseproject-dev/gcc-postcommit-ci`
- `riseproject-dev/gcc-precommit-ci`

The upstream RISC-V GNU toolchain project remains the source for normal
toolchain documentation and build behavior. This fork exists so CI-specific
scripts, Patchwork helpers, artifact lookup code, and test utilities can be
maintained under RISE ownership without depending on a personal repository.

## Updating The Submodule Revision

1. Make changes on `build-frequent`.
2. Run the migration guard, local Python tests, and pre-commit hooks, in that
   order:

   ```sh
   python scripts/check_migration_guards.py
   pytest test/pytests -m 'not github_token_required'
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. Commit and merge the toolchain change, then record the published commit SHA.
4. Only after that commit is available, update both CI repositories so their
   `riscv-gnu-toolchain` gitlink points to that SHA and `.gitmodules` uses
   `https://github.com/riseproject-dev/riscv-gnu-toolchain-ci.git`.
5. Run submodule sync and initialization checks in both CI repositories.
6. Merge and release in dependency order: this repository first, post-commit
   CI second, and pre-commit CI last. Do not publish a parent CI update before
   its referenced toolchain commit is reachable.

Pull-request validation does not need production baseline artifacts or a
cross-repository token. Some patch-discovery tests read public Patchwork data;
for an offline run, add
`--ignore=test/pytests/test_scripts/test_create_patches_files.py`.

After post-commit CI has published a valid baseline and retained artifacts,
maintainers can manually dispatch `Pre-Pull-Request` with
`run_integration_tests=true`. Set the toolchain repository's
`RISE_CI_READ_TOKEN` secret to a RISE service credential with read access to
post-commit Actions artifacts. The ordinary repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot
provide this cross-repository artifact access. This optional production check
is deliberately independent of the checks required to merge the toolchain PR.

## Repository Configuration

Runtime helpers default to these RISE repositories:

- `POSTCOMMIT_REPOSITORY=riseproject-dev/gcc-postcommit-ci`
- `PRECOMMIT_REPOSITORY=riseproject-dev/gcc-precommit-ci`

Override them only for intentional staging or local testing. Missing baselines,
GitHub API failures, invalid issue payloads, and empty result sets should fail
with an actionable error instead of falling back to a personal repository.

`PATCHWORK_CHECK_USERNAME` is required by `scripts/check_patch_checks.py`. Set
it to the Patchwork username of the RISE CI account in the invoking workflow or
repository configuration. There is no legacy-account fallback. Completed
testsuite checks are recognized by the `toolchain-ci-rise-test` context.

`PATCHWORK_REPORTING_ENABLED` must be exactly `true` before Patchwork results
are posted. When it is disabled, `scripts/post_check_to_patchworks.py` does not
require a token. When it is enabled, a real Patchwork API token is mandatory
and any non-success response fails the command.

Aggregation marks a report `invalid` if any summary is damaged or a downloaded
testsuite report lacks its corresponding summary, even if other targets
completed. Artifact lookup skips expired entries; a failed download reports its
HTTP status before writing an archive.

## Patchwork Filtering

Patch discovery continues to read the GCC project on Patchwork. The scripts
always match RISC-V terms in patch bodies. If maintainers need mailbox-based
matching, configure `PATCHWORK_FILTER_EMAILS` as a comma-separated list in the
workflow environment or repository variables.

Overlap recovery only trusts checks from `PATCHWORK_CHECK_USERNAME` in the
`toolchain-ci-rise-` context namespace. A pending check from this service means
the patch has already started. With no username configured, shadow discovery
keeps overlapping patches instead of trusting another service's checks; a patch
can therefore be included in both adjacent polling windows. Nightly recovery
still requires an explicit username.

The first scheduled run in a new repository uses the preceding 15 minutes as
its discovery window, plus the normal 15-minute overlap. Later runs start from
the previous scheduled run's timestamp, including gaps in polling.

## Release Policy

Maintained release helpers follow the existing `release_15_` artifact prefix
and `release-15` workflow conventions. The current maintained release branch
uses the same convention with `release_16_` and `release-16`.
